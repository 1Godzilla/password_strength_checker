Password Strength Checker

A Python-based tool to evaluate the strength of a password based on various security criteria and provide feedback for improvement. The password strength checker also suggests a strong password if the input password is deemed weak.

Features

	•	Strength Analysis: Checks the strength of a password based on length, character types, and common security practices.
	•	Feedback: Provides detailed feedback on weak passwords and suggests improvements.
	•	Strong Password Suggestion: Generates and suggests a secure, randomly generated password if the input is weak.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x

Setup

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-checker.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd password-strength-checker


	3.	Run the script:

python password_strength_checker.py



Usage

	1.	Run the script, and you’ll be prompted to enter a password.
	2.	The program will evaluate the password’s strength and display feedback on its security level (Weak, Moderate, or Strong).
	3.	If the password is weak, the program will suggest improvements and offer a secure password suggestion.

Example

Enter a password to check its strength: example
Weak password.
Password should be at least 12 characters long.
Password should include at least one uppercase letter.
Password should include at least one special character.

Suggested strong password: Ab$3Hj7z!QpK

Project Structure

	•	password_strength_checker.py: The main script that includes password strength checking functionality and password generation.

How It Works

The password strength checker evaluates passwords based on:

	•	Length (recommended minimum: 12 characters)
	•	Presence of uppercase letters
	•	Presence of lowercase letters
	•	Inclusion of numbers
	•	Inclusion of special characters (e.g., @, $, !, %, *, ?, &)

If a password does not meet these criteria, the script provides suggestions for improvement.
